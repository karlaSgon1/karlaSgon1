## Websites I recommend

Best website I use to learn different [**programming languages**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Best for those that want to get started in programming. It's free to use, and you can even get certifications for finishing the lessons. 
Website/App I use to watch Korean, Chinese [**dramas**](https://www.viki.com/) - Great shows are found on this website, you can watch certain dramas for free and others that need you to have a subscription. 
[**Netflix**](https://www.netflix.com) - So many good shows, documentaries and soap operas. I can even use VPN's to watch shows from other countries. 
[**Crunchyroll**](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) - A good website for anime. They add new anime series regularly and they all have english subtitles or english dubbed episodes. 
[**Google**](https://www.google.com/) - Can find all kinds of things thanks to this search engine.
